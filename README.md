# Kit

Kit by Parashell is a source-available CAD interchange SDK for translating geometry, feature trees, assemblies and more between proprietary formats.

## _Currently_ supported CAD software

- SOLIDWORKS
- Parashell
- FreeCAD

## _Planned_ (in-order)

1. Fusion360
2. CATIA
3. NX
4. Rhino
5. Creo
6. AutoCAD

## Supported formats

| CAD        | suffixes                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| SOLIDWORKS | `.SLDPRT`, `.SLDASM`      |
| FreeCAD    | `.FCStd`                  |
| CATIA      | `.CATPart`, `.CATProduct` |

Kit reads and writes these formats natively, without requiring CAD software to be installed.

## Architecture

Every conversion follows one route:

```text
source file -> reader adapter -> (ORACLE) -> writer adapter -> destination file
```

## Converting

`convert(source, destination)` reads the source, builds a `CadDocument`, and writes the destination format inferred from its suffix:

```python
from kit import convert

result = convert("bracket.SLDPRT", "bracket.FCStd")
```

The returned `ConversionResult` carries the document, the write result, and the attestation describing which capabilities survived the round trip.

### Default reversible swaps

By default a conversion is reversible.

### Strict mode

Pass `allow_carrier=False` to refuse a carrier result. The write then fails with
`ApplicationUsabilityError` unless the attestation reports the output as application usable and
vendor loadable, with nothing dropped and no unmet requirements:

```python
result = convert("bracket.SLDPRT", "bracket.FCStd", allow_carrier=False)
```

## Distribution

Kit is source-available under the PolyForm Strict License 1.0.0
