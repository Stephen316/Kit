# `re/` — reverse-engineering workspace

Durable reverse-engineering findings and tooling for native CAD formats. The SOLIDWORKS
workspace described below retains its original structure. The imported
[Fusion study](Fusion/README.md) contains the experimental Fusion decoder, saved
captures and validation evidence, with its source history preserved.

`Methodology.md` is the reusable playbook — read it first if your target is AutoCAD, CATIA, NX or
Creo. The existing SOLIDWORKS directories provide the worked example that the playbook was
distilled from. `Fusion/` preserves a separate native-file study and its original commit history.

## Size

| part                                             | size           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Existing SOLIDWORKS workspace excluding binaries | **~7.3 MiB**   |
| The four vendor DLLs in `re/binaries/`           | **~51.9 MiB**  |
| Imported Fusion study and evidence               | **~278.1 MiB** |
| `re/` total, including the Fusion import         | **~337.3 MiB** |

The DLLs are **tracked**, deliberately, so that a cloud agent with no SOLIDWORKS install can run
Ghidra against them. Read `binaries/README.md` for the licensing position before this repository is
shared with anyone outside Parashell — they are unmodified proprietary Dassault Systèmes binaries
from a licensed local install, and `binaries/Fetch.ps1` reproduces them from that install if you
would rather not carry them.

Within the SOLIDWORKS workspace, the bulk of the tracked bytes is machine-readable evidence: `re/data/` (~4.6 MB, dominated by the
static container census and the traced object segmentations) and `re/solidworks/measurements/`
(~1.1 MB of volume measurements). The prose is about 380 KB.

| `tooling/`    | how the work was done and how to redo it: `ghidra/` (headless decompilation), `windbg/` (the cdb runtime trace), `harness/` (the COM measurement loop).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `data/`       | the extracted tables and traced artefacts the findings cite: the 1000-entry signature table, the 2607-class `Serialize` map, the object segmentations, the class vocabulary.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| how objects are tagged inside a stream, and why byte edits renumber | `solidworks/archive/Grammar.md` §2, then `archive/Segmentation.md` |
| what class owns a given byte                                        | `solidworks/records/Serialize.md`, then `data/SerializeMap.json`   |
| whether a specific field is trustworthy                             | the confidence column of the table that declares it — see below    |
| what has been _measured_ rather than inferred                       | `solidworks/measurements/README.md`                                |
| what does not work, and the traps                                   | `solidworks/README.md` "Negative results and traps"                |
| how to reproduce the decompilation                                  | `tooling/ghidra/Setup.md`                                          |
| how to reproduce the runtime trace                                  | `tooling/windbg/README.md`                                         |

## Confidence vocabulary

Every field table in `re/solidworks/` labels each row. The vocabulary is defined in
`solidworks/records/Serialize.md` and used consistently everywhere:

- **confirmed** — read out of the decompiled `Serialize` _and_ the byte arithmetic reproduces a real
  traced object span, a real corpus record, or a measured volume exactly.
- **partial** — read out of the decompiled `Serialize`, but nothing available exercises the field:
  its value is constant across the corpus, or the branch is never taken, so nothing independent
  checks it.
- **not found** (spelled **unresolved** in the oldest tables) — not recovered.

Treat the distinction as load-bearing. A **partial** offset is a hypothesis with an address, not a
fact; several of them turned out to be uninitialised memory rather than parameters.

## Reproducing

Everything here was produced on Windows with PowerShell, `uv` for Python, a licensed SOLIDWORKS 2025
install, Ghidra 12.1.2 headless, and `cdbX64.exe` from the WinDbg MSIX package.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File re\binaries\Fetch.ps1
uv run python re\tooling\ghidra\Sigtable.py
uv run python re\tooling\ghidra\Generation\SerializeMap.py
uv run python re\tooling\ghidra\Validation\VerifyLayout.py
```

The first re-fetches and verifies the binaries. The other three re-derive `data/SignatureTable.json`,
`data/SerializeMap.json` and `data/VerifyLayout.json` from the binaries plus the traced
segmentations, and they rewrite those files in place — a clean `git diff` after running them is the
cheapest end-to-end check that the recorded tables really do come out of the recorded bytes.

`tooling/README.md` states, per script, what still needs inputs that live in the gitignored
`.rescratch/` working directory (the `.SLDPRT` corpora and the multi-megabyte Ghidra dumps).

## What is deliberately not here

- The Ghidra 12.1.2 distribution (3.4 GB) and its release zip (573 MB). `tooling/ghidra/Setup.md`
  has the download URL, the exact filename and its byte size.
- The portable FreeCAD used to author `.FCStd` inputs (2.2 GB).
- The `.SLDPRT` / `.SLDASM` corpora. The real-world corpus already lives in the repository at
  `examples/`; the authored corpora live in `.rescratch/{corpus,corpus2,trace,donors,arc,grammar}/parts`
  and are referenced by path, not copied. `solidworks/corpus/README.md` maps every corpus to its
  location and to what it proves.
- Raw cdb logs (~3.4 MB) and the decompiled C dumps (~24 MB). The `cdb` scripts that generate the
  logs are in `tooling/windbg/`; the spec files and wrappers that generate the dumps are in
  `tooling/ghidra/`. The _conclusions_ are in `re/solidworks/` and the _segmentations_ in
  `re/data/segments/`.
- Ghidra project databases, `__pycache__`, and any generated `.SLDPRT`.

## Scope honesty

The SOLIDWORKS work reads and _patches_ SOLIDWORKS streams. It does not serialise one from nothing. The
container framing is fully inverted (any of 1000 file ids can be written with no donor); stream
content still comes from a donor part of the right feature topology. `solidworks/README.md` states
exactly where that line falls.
