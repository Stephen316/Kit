# Agent guidance

## Portable steering

The portable version of this repository's Kiro steering lives in
`.agents/skills/` as [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification).
Each kebab-case skill is generated from its mapped PascalCase source file in
`.kiro/steering/`.

- Do not edit generated `SKILL.md` files directly. Update the corresponding
  `.kiro/steering/<PascalCaseName>.md` source, then run
  `python tools/skills/MigrateKiroSteering.py --write`.
- Before completing a change to steering, run
  `python tools/skills/MigrateKiroSteering.py --check`.
- Read and follow every skill whose description matches the task before
  changing the associated files. See `.agents/README.md` for the complete
  source-to-skill mapping.

## Always-on project constraints

- Never commit, push, pull into, or otherwise write to `main`. Work only on a
  non-protected working branch.
- Deliver complete, verified work. Do not leave stubs, placeholders, or known
  failures behind.
- Format each changed source file with its project formatter and run focused
  verification before reporting completion.
- Use `uv` rather than `pip` for Python dependency management, except in the
  explicitly exempt `Parashell/` and `modules/` workspaces.
- New non-skill text files must start with the exact notice in `HEADER_NOTICE`.
- Treat every unknown commit, branch, staged change, unstaged change, untracked
  file, and background Git operation as user-owned state. Preserve it and work
  around it unless the user explicitly says otherwise.

## Reverse engineering workspace exemption

The repository-root `re/` tree is an unrestricted research workspace. Do not
apply unit-test requirements or code standards there, including naming,
formatting, typing, imports, rationale comments, SPDX headers, declaration
splitting, architecture, or directory-density rules. Do not add unit tests or
run code-quality checks for `re/` as part of repository compliance.

This exemption takes precedence over all code and testing guidance in this
file, `.kiro/steering/`, and `.agents/skills/`. It applies only to `re/` and its
descendants; code promoted into other directories follows their normal rules.
Git isolation and preservation of user-owned work still apply.

## Test policy

- Unit tests are prohibited. Do not add, restore, generate, or request tests of
  individual functions, methods, classes, or internal helpers in isolation.
- This ban also covers policy, security, and tooling unit tests. Do not relabel
  isolated tests as integration tests to bypass it.
- Validate behavior through integration, end-to-end, smoke, compatibility, and
  repository-wide policy checks at real component or process boundaries.
- Run tests only in pull request CI, never locally. Keep all applicable CI checks
  enabled and require them to pass.
- This policy takes precedence over any skill requesting unit tests or a test
  file for each implementation module.

## Agent Skills SPDX exception

`SKILL.md` files must begin with their required YAML frontmatter to remain
Agent Skills-compatible. For `.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md`, use the required
`license: MIT` frontmatter field instead of
placing the normal comment notice before the frontmatter. All other new files
continue to use the exact `HEADER_NOTICE` block.
